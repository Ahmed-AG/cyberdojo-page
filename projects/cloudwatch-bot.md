## Cloudwatch-bot
Cloudwatch-bot is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates how AI can be utilized to interface with security solutions. The project has a user interface that is built using HTML and JavaScript and is hosted on a public S3 bucket. The UI communicates with a backend system that includes an API Gateway and a Lambda function, which is written in Python and has permission to access OpenAI and CloudWatch. When a user makes a request, the API Gateway triggers the Lambda function, which translates the request using OpenAI into a CloudWatch query that searches for relevant information in CloudWatch logs. <a id="cloudwatch-bot-demo"></a>[Use it LIVE here.](cloudwatch-bot.html){:target="_blank"}
